# Recycle Rush
### A game where you have to quickly sort falling garbage into the correct recycling bins and save the planet from waste!

## Motivation
I'm and ocean additc. I spend most of my free time in the water, from diving to sail, from spearfishing to kitesurfing. It's my happy place and I want to keep my playground safe.

Careless and improper waste disposal is a big contributor to ocean litter. Recycling helps keep plastics out of the ocean and reduces the amount of “new” plastic in circulation. This educational game helps you figuring out how to recycle, by gamifying your learnings.

## Description
The game is made up of three screens:
- Game-intro screen: instructions and start button
- Game screen: play the game by sorting the falling trash into the recycling bins. You score points by assigning trash to the correct bin, and lose them otherwise. You also loose points by dropping trash on the floor.
- Game-over screen: recycling facts are displayed randomly so you a learn as you lose :)

I used JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS to build my game. Several audio and images assets to make the game more enjoyable and interactive.
